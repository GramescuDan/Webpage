I added Text Here!Again

I selected the changes i wanted to keep
text conflict:	I edited a part of the file in my branch that wasn't in the project so i got a conflict.
if the project needs my changes, at the conflict i would choose my part.
	
Deleted conflict: i edited a file that didn't exist in main.
I add it again
